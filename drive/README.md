# Quickstart: Run a Drive App

Complete the steps described in the rest of this page, and in less than five
minutes you'll have a simple Drive app that uploads a file to Google Drive.

## Enable the Drive API

This API uses OAuth 2.0. Learn more about Google APIs and OAuth 2.0 here:
https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2

Or, if you'd like to dive right in, follow these steps.

- Visit https://console.developers.google.com/start/api?id=drive to create or select a project in the Google Developers Console and automatically turn on the API. Click Continue, then Go to credentials.
- At the top of the page, select the OAuth consent screen tab. Select an Email address, enter a Product name if not already set, and click the Save button.
- Select the Credentials tab, click the Add credentials button and select OAuth 2.0 client ID.
- Select the application type Other, enter the name "Drive API Quickstart", and click the Create button.
- Click OK to dismiss the resulting dialog.
- Click the (Download JSON) button to the right of the client ID. Move this file to your working directory and rename it client_secrets.json.
- Place the client_secrets.json file in `secrets/client_secrets.json` along side the drive.rb script.

## Install the Google Client Library

Requires Ruby `2.3.1`.

To run the quickstart sample, you'll need to install the Google API client
library.

    bundle install

## Set up the sample

Create a text file named `document.docx`.

## Run the Sample

After you have set up your Google API project, installed the Google API client
library, and set up the sample source code, the sample is ready to run.  The
command-line samples provide a link you'll need to visit in order to
authorize the sample.

    bundle exec ruby drive.rb document.docx

1. Browse to the provided URL in your web browser.
2. If you are not already logged into your Google account, you will be prompted
   to log in.  If you are logged into multiple Google accounts, you will be
   asked to select one account to use for the authorization.
3. The application automatically receives the authentication code and resumes
   operation.

When you finish these steps, `document.docx` is now stored in Google Drive.
The command-line samples print Information about the Google Drive file to the screen.
The file `document.docx` is accessible in Google Drive, and is titled "My
Document".

By editing the sample code to provide paths to new files and new titles,
you can run a few more simple upload tests. When you're ready, you
could try running some other Drive API methods such as
[files.list](http://developers.google.com/drive/v2/reference/files/list).

## Next Steps

If your goal is to let users create and open files directly from the Drive UI
using your app, see [Integrate with the Drive UI](https://developers.google.com/drive/enable-sdk).
Our end-to-end [Example Apps](https://developers.google.com/drive/examples/index) demonstrate a simple
Drive UI-integrated web app.

If your goal is to expand the quickstart sample into something for your own
installed application, consult the [API Reference](https://developers.google.com/drive/v2/reference). The
API Reference discusses all of the features of the Drive API, and gives
samples in each language on how to use a feature.

All requests to the Drive API must be authorized by an authenticated user.
To examine more authorization code and learn how to authorize requests,
see [Retrieve and Use Credentials](https://developers.google.com/drive/credentials).
